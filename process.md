# Process

Process can be:
- Independent process
- Co-operating process

A co-operating process can be affected by the execution of another process, because of that, processes can use Inter Process Communication (IPC) to communicate and synchronize.  
The communication between two processes can be:
- Shared Memory
- Message passing
